To compile you need SFML2.0 at least

To get this version you just need to write in console:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sonkun/sfml-development
sudo apt-get update

# If you have already installed SFML1.6 you should remove it via
sudo apt-get remove libsfml*

# And then install SFML2.0
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

The project is set up on qtcreator.
On qtcreator you don't want to work on a **shadow build**, so untick that from the project options when it asks you
